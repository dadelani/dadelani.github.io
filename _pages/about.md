* I am an Assistant Professor at McGill School of Computer Science, Canada a Core Academic Member at <a target="_blank"  href="https://mila.quebec/en/">MILA</a>, and a [Canada CIFAR AI Chair](https://cifar.ca/bios/david-ifeoluwa-adelani/) (in 2024). I will be recruiting MSc/PhD students for fall 2025, if you are interested, please apply through <a target="_blank"  href="https://mila.quebec/en/supervision-requests/">MILA's request for supervision </a> (deadline Decemeber 1, 2024). Previously, I was a DeepMind Academic Fellow at UCL, and I obtained a PhD in Computer Science at Saarland University. For more information, see my [CV](https://dadelani.github.io/cv/)
* My research focuses on multilingual NLP and Speech processing especially for low-resource languages. My PhD focused on [NLP for African languages](https://dadelani.github.io/files/PhD_Thesis.pdf) but now I am expanding to various regions of the world including South Asia, South-East Asia and Americas indigeneous languages. For more information on my research interests, see my [Research Statement](https://dadelani.github.io/files/research_statement.pdf).
